## User Passwords

### Exposure

User passwords and saving user passwords can be a huge vulnerability.
Any site that saved only the user passwords that gets hacked can cause
a leak of passwords, making users and their accounts compromised.

This vulnerability would have a major effect on the site, allowing a 
single database being compromised would cause a lot of damage, especially
in a site that uses online payment.

### Repair

Register.cshtml.cs and Register.cshtml were the two files involving
taking in a user password and saving it.  This was mitigated by using
ASP.NET Core Identity. Using Identity's database and hashing/salting
algorithms, our user passwords are never stored in the database, and the
vulnerability is avoided.

## Database Access Calls

### Exposure

Database tables can be manipulated if a user knows how to write queries
in the input fields.

This vulnerability would give users access to information that wasn't
directly displayed to them, allowing access that would otherwise be 
forbidden.

### Repair

All service files, CartService.cs, DonutService.cs and OrderService.cs
were all at risk for this vulernability because they are interacting with
the database directly.  The ORM Entity Framework Core was implemented,
allowing no SQL strings to be used when accessing the database. This
ensures that no user inputted strings would be able to access the database
in the incorrect way.
