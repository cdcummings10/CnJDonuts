## Description

The product of the ecommerce store is donuts. We decided on donuts because they are delicious.

Accounts can be created via Windows Identity. The accounts are stored in
a specific user database. On registration, claims for first name, birthdate
and email are added. First name is captured for a personalized greeting. Age is captured to see if the member is over 21.
Email is captured for email and access purposes.
